These eight- or nine-digit codes begin with one or two digits that correspond to the quarters (administrative level 1 features) and then seven digits with no discernible significance.

Castries features have ‘1’, ‘2’, or ‘3’ prefixes that form non-geographically contiguous groups. As the names and significance of these groups are unknown, the Castries features were given a common and nationally distinct ‘13’ prefix in the OCHA P-code system. To preserve the ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’ designations, to provide a distinct formulation for all of Castries features, and to maintain the source settlement codes the OHCA P-code system comprises the national code (‘LC’), the new prefixes (‘4’ to ‘13’) and the original settlement codes (padded to nine digits).

The source dataset had two administrative level 2 features, ‘Petit Piton’ and ‘Ti Delcer’ in Soufriere quarter with the same ‘settlement code’ (60720000). These have been given the distinct P-codes LC06060720001 and LC06060720002 respectively.

Some other sources (such as www.citypopulation.de) distinguish the ‘Central Forest Reserve’ (LC11110450000) as a distinct quarter but this is not supported by its settlement code.

Similarly the Butha-Buthe Urban Council spans 2 districts (the number of council records therefore totals 78 not 76, in order to accommodate the district divisions).
P-codes were added for the Municipal and Urban Councils, which had no codes in the original data received (based on the district code and next consecutive number).
The old boundary system prior to 2016 had 10 districts sub-divided into 80 constituencies consisting of 128/129 local community councils (the UNHCR SAHIMS data is of the old 80 constituencies). However, recently the number of community councils was reduced from 128 to 64 to align with the national parliamentary constituencies, following which 11 urban councils were established.
